# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

#Overview:
Welcome to the Fake News Detection project! This repository contains a powerful machine learning application designed to classify news articles as either Fake or Not Fake. Leveraging various machine learning algorithms, this project aims to help users discern the authenticity of news articles and combat misinformation.

#Features:

Multiple ML Algorithms: We utilize a variety of machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
User Input: Easily input news articles via the provided interface to get instant feedback on their authenticity.
Comprehensive Analysis: Detailed reports and visualizations help understand the decision-making process of the models.

#Algorithms Used:

Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective linear model for binary classification.
Decision Tree: A non-linear model that splits data into subsets based on feature values.
Gradient Boosting Classifier: An ensemble technique that builds multiple models sequentially to improve performance.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble of decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy.
